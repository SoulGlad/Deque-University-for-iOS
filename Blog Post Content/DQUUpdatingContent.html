		<h1>Updating Content</h1>
		<p>Updating Content are elements that constantly change, such as clocks and scrolling advertisements.</p>
		<h3>Accessible Updating Content</h3>
		<p>Updating Content can be difficult to make accessible.  Unlike dynamic elements that only change through user action, items that constantly change should not have every update announced by VoiceOver.  This will make the app more difficult to navigate, thus deeming the app inaccessible (pretty counterproductive!).  However, do not try to avoid this by making updating content not accessible at all.  It is important for VoiceOver users to receive the same information that sighted users obtain through visuals.  To make updating content accessible, use <code>UIAccessibilityPostNotification</code>.  More information about this function can be found in "Implementing Dynamic Notifications" in <a href = "DQUDynamicNotifications.html">this blog post</a>.
		<h3>Finding the Balance</h3>
		<p>Every situation will be slightly different with updating content as to the best way to implement accessibility.  Updating content should have enough accessibility that VoiceOver users know what is focused and have a general sense of its content; however, it should not have so many notifications that it disrupts usability and functionality of the app.  One example of this is a clock displaying the current hour, minute, and second.  When a user tabs over to the clock, it should not announce the time every second, for VoiceOver will not be able to announce the time in a second.  It will fall behind on notifications very quickly and relay outdated information to the user.  The correct way to fix this is not to make the clock an inaccessible element; instead, it might be best to have the clock only announce the hour and minute, or have it announce the time once every 5 seconds.</p>
		<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
		<p>As stated previously, every scenario with updating content is different, so the solutions as to how to make updating content accessible will rely on the situation.  Listed below are some potential ideas as to how to make these elements more accessible.</p>
		<h4>Start/Stop Button</h4>
		<p>This could be useful for elements that continually require VoiceOver to focus on them.  Instead of interrupting the user, potentially making certain parts inaccessible (such as a long paragraph), implementing a stop and/or start button can help make other elements accessible again.  An example of this can be seen in our Deque University for iOS app available in the App Store.</p>
		<h4>"Updates Frequently" Trait</h4>
		<p>There is an Accessibility Trait called "Updates Frequently," located in the Identity Inspector in XCode (pictured below).  If an element updates constantly and VoiceOver is unable to keep up with the updates when focused, the "Updates Frequently" trait might help.  Instead of updating the accessibility label/hint every time it updates, VoiceOver only announces an update once every four or five seconds.  More information about Accessibility Traits can be found in our <a href = "DQUAccessibilityTraits.html">blog post</a>.  This could be helpful in the previous example of the clock.  Because VoiceOver is unable to announce the full time once every second, checking the "Updates Frequently" trait for the clock object will help VoiceOver update the user only every four or five seconds.</p>

		<h4>Remove Non-Essential Information</h4>
		<p>While not optimal, if needed, it is possible to programmatically update the label of the updating element, so that it only states the most important information.  An example of this is again the clock - instead of announcing the hour, minute, and second, VoiceOver could only announce the hour and minute.</p>
