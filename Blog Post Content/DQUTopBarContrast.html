		<h1>Top Bar Contrast</h1>
		<p>Top Bar Contrast refers to the color contrast between the item color in the Top Bar of iPads (which includes elements like the time and the battery status) and the background color/image of the current app.  Because the iPad does not have a navigation bar, unlike the iPhone, the background color of the Top Bar will change with the background color of the app.  If the contrast is not enough, it may be impossible for users to effectively use the Top Bar.</p>
		<h3>Color Contrast</h3>
		<p>Checking to make sure that a background color and its text are contrasted enough is simple.  There are many different Color Contrast Analyzer programs.  We personally use the <a href = "http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/">Colour Contrast Analyser</a>.  (Note that Deque Systems Inc did not create this program.)  When testing colors, we only use a background color and text color if they pass both "Large Text" tests and the first "Text" test.  The image below is an example of two colors being tested that we used in the Deque University for iOS app.</p>

		<h3>Fixing Background Color for the Top Bar</h3>
		<p><strong>Note: this only affects iPads.</strong></p>
		<p>If you notice that the background color of the Top Bar changes with the background color of your app, there is a simple fix to this.</p>
		<p>In iOS development, the default background view changes the Top Bar background color as well.  To fix this, add a view or a scroll view as your background view.  (A scroll view is recommended for Dynamic Type.  To learn more, click <a href = "DQUDynamicType.html">here</a>.)  Steps to add a background view are outlined below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In XCode, select every element that should be in front of the new background view (hold down "Command" while clicking on the items).</li>
			<li>Click on "Editor" in the menu bar, then roll over "Embed In" and select either "Scroll View" or "View" (see image below).</li>
			<li>Add constraints to your new view as needed.  Make sure the height of this new background view is constrained to the Top and Bottom Layout Guides.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>You can then add your background color/image to the new background view.  Make sure also to remove the background color or image of the parent background view.  The default for the parent view should be white.  If you absolutely need to change its background color, make sure that its background color passes the Colour Contrast Analyser tests.</p>
		<h3>Discussion</h3>
		<h4><i>Why is this important?</i></h4>
		<p>Color contrast is important not only for accessibility, but for usability purposes.  If the background color is not contrasting enough with the text color, users with and without sight impairments may not be able to effectively read text.  For example, if there is black text on a dark blue background, there is certainly not enough contrast.  Users are not going to be able to read the text well.  Another example of this is if there is a bright, multicolored image as a background, no color may be best to contrast effectively with this.  For the best user experience, an additional white view containing all text may need to be added, with or without slight transparency to still be able to see the background image.  When colors do not contrast well, the user experience can be very frustrating, so it is best to avoid this so your user may have the best experience possible.</p>
