			<h4>Nested Accessibility Elements Don't Get Announced</h4>
			<p>Accessibility elements that are within other accessibility elements will not be focusable by VoiceOver. This is a very bad accessibility issue, but luckily an easy fix. Here's why we don't nest accessibility:</p>
			<p>The outer element gets focused and announced</p>

			<p>The user swipes right</p>

			<p>Oh no! VoiceOver skipped all the accessibility elements within the music player!</p>
			<img src="Images/Nesteda11yBroken3.png">
			<p>The user has no idea what just happened because VoiceOver has skipped over arguably the most important content on the screen. It's obvious that this is a serious usability issue for users who rely on VoiceOver to show them what is going on in the application.</p>

			<h3>The Fix</h3>
			<h4>Provide detailed info for each element</h4>
			<p>To fix this issue, instead of adding accessibility information for the container element, add detailed information for each element within that class. In our case, we want the user to know that the elements play music when they are pressed. Thus, we add the accessibility label for the name of the song, and then an accessibility hint that tells the user that the button plays music.</p>

			<p>Note that only one element at a time is selected now. Simply turn off accessibility for the container element under the Identity Inspector in the Storyboard Editor. Doing this for all your containers with accessibility elements inside of them is a great way to keep your app usable for people who require VoiceOver to announce screen elements.</>

			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep your labels and hints concise, while still providing enough information to let the user know exactly what is going on.</li>
				<li>If you have multiple nestings, make sure only the lowest layer that you want accessibility information for has accessibility turned on.</li>
			</ul>
