		<h1 id="mainTitle">Accessibility Traits</h1>
		<p id="introduction">Accessibility Traits are yet another useful and important feature in the realm of iOS Accessibility. An accessibility Trait allows you to choose the best description for what an element in your application does.</p>
		<p>A trait is like an extra accessibility Label, that lets a user know how your button, link, text field, etc. will react upon interaction. It is important to set up these traits properly so that a user does not get confused when clicking on a "Text Field" opens the web browser.</p>

			<h3 id="storyboardEditorTitle">Implementing Accessibility Traits</h3>
			<h4>Storyboard Editor</h4>
			<p>Accessibility Traits don't often change while the app is running, so for most people, this method will suffice.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to your storyboard editor in XCode</li>
				<li>Click on the element you would like to add a Trait for</li>
				<li>Open the Identity Inspector in the right bar</li>
				<li>Enable Accessibility by checking the box that says "Enabled"</li>
				<li>Scroll down to Accessibility and check the box for the trait(s) that you would like to apply</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Below is what this looks like for the Dog button in the Traits Section of the Deque U app.</p>

			<p>You will want to add only the trait that best describes the behavior of your element. For instance, as in the Traits Demo of our <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/Deque-University-for-iOS">Deque U app</a>, if your element opens a web page, you should label it as a link, even if it is a UIButton. Doubling up on traits can be confusing and unnecessary in some situations. Some of the most common mistakes include </p>

			<h4>Programmatic Approach</h4>
			<p>In most apps, Accessibility traits will remain constant at runtime. However, for more advanced applications with a large amount of dynamic content, it may be necessary to change or add Accessibility Traits at runtime. To add or change traits in your code, follow the directions below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Storyboard Editor, turn on accessibility for the item that you want to set a trait for, just like in the first part of this demo</li>
				<li>Pull up the header file for your View Controller in the Assistant Editor</li>
				<li>Ctrl click and drag from your element to the header file to create an IBOutlet for your element</li>
				<li>Now open your implementation file for your ViewController</li>
				<li>Use the <code>accessibilityTrait</code> member OR the <code>setAccessibilityTrait</code> function to add the appropriate <code>UIAccessibilityTraits</code> value.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Below are the two ways to set an accessibility Trait.</p>
			<code>_DogDisplay.accessibilityLabel = UIAccessibilityTraitButton; <br>
				  [_DogDisplay setAccessibilityTrait:UIAccessibilityTraitButton];</code>
			<p>There are many possible values for the UIAccessibilityTrait. A full list can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAccessibility_Protocol/#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Accessibility_Traits">here</a></p>

			<h3>Discussion</h3>
			<h4>Why you should care about traits</h4>
			<p>While the impact of traits may seem somewhat subtle and insignificant, it is vastly important in the realm of iOS Accessibility. Traits let the Accessibility API know specific information about your elements that can help VoiceOver and other aspects of the API handle your elements in a clearer and more uniform way.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure that the traits you assign to elements accurately reflect what that element is/does, assigning multiple traits is almost always unnecessary!</li>
				<li>If the content on the page is dynamic, make sure that your traits change when the function of an element changes</li>
			</ul>
