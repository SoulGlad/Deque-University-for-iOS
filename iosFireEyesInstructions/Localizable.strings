"INTRO_ABOUT_APP" = "This app goes through example scenarios you may encounter when programming your own apps, and explains how they are inaccessible as well as what can be done to make them accessibile.  Before moving on, it is recommended that you enable VoiceOver, as well as the \"3-click\" VoiceOver on/off shortcut.  The \"Guided Tour\" will take you through a list of accessibility concepts one by one, and the \"Accessibility Contents\" will allow you to pick a specific topic you're struggling with.";

"A11Y_ABOUT_TEXTVIEW" = "When a user interracts with an application, certain aspects of the application are immediately apparent.  Visual clues, other apps you've dealt with in the past, UI conventions and so forth all help a user understand what it is an application does.  Accessibility is about portraying this same information, but to users with different capabilities.  The following scenarios aim to help you to understand the difficulties users with dissabilities have when interracting with iOS applications,  as well as the techniques and conventions you can use to portray this information using basic iOS APIs.";

//Traits story
"TRAIT_INFO_TEXTVIEW1" = "Traits help identify what a button does.  Each trait has a very specific purpose.  Some traits, such as button/link communicate purpose to VoiceOver users, while others like 'Updates Frequently' communicate information about the behavior of an item to VoiceOver, to ensure that it behaves reasonably.";

"TRAIT_INFO_TEXTVIEW2" = "When a sighted user uses an application, they get hints about what UI Elements do based on their appearance.  Traits help communicate this same information to non-sighted users.";

"TRAIT_EXAMPLE_TEXTVIEW" = "Below is a screen similar to the one in the Labels example, however, notice that one of the buttons looks a little different.  It's appearance would suggest that it is a link.";

"TRAIT_BROKEN_TEXTVIEW" = "Notice the last button appropriately has the trait of a link (because it opens a webpage), but it also has the trait of a button.  A link is a specialization of a button (an element that expects interraction).  To enable both is redundant, unnecessary, and misleading.";

"TRAIT_FIXED_TEXTVIEW" = "Here we have removed the unnecessary traits to clarify the purpose of the last button.  There are many examples of traits that should not be paired together.";

//Labels Story
"LABEL_INFO_TEXTVIEW1" = "Labels help identify 'What' an object is.  Labels should be short and concise.  If you are tempted to make a label longer than a word or two, it is likely that the information you're adding belongs in the hint.  Labels should start with a capital letter and end with no punctuation.  This helps voiceover get the correct inflection.  Labels should not contain information about the type of control.  This information is stored in the trait.";

"LABEL_INFO_TEXTVIEW2" = "Labels provide information to voiceover quickly.  Unlike hints, whose readout is delayed.  When designing accessible applications you want to keep two particular users in mind.  The power user, and the new user.  Think of labels as something to help power users.  The person who knows that a row of buttons are links, or that they play music.  They don't need to be reminded that a button is going to visit a webpage, they just need to know which page they will be visiting.";

"LABEL_EXAMPLE_TEXTVIEW" = "Below is an example where the context of the buttons is obvious.  Clearly each button is going to display a picture.  The labels for each button are the pictures that are to be displayed.";

"LABEL_FIXED_TEXTVIEW" = "Here we have added the relevant accessibility information.  Now, with voiceover turned on, you can easily tell which picture is going to be displayed.";

//Nested Story
"NESTED_FIXED_TEXTVIEW" = "By removing the parent view from the list of 'Accessibility Elements' the buttons within become focusable.  A very serious problem, but a very easy fix!";

"NESTED_BROKEN_TEXTVIEW" = "Notice how, when you turn VoiceOver on, a black box shows up around our music player.  You cannot interract with the button elements inside this box!";

"NESTED_EXAMPLE_TEXTVIEW" = "Remember our music player?  In this view we have added a parent view around our entire player.  This is a very reasonable separation of functionality";

"NESTED_INFORMATION_TEXTVIEW1" = "When you mark an element an 'Accessibility Element' you're telling VoiceOver that it is an element that requires user interraction.  You cannot place one such element inside another.  If you do, only the outer element will be focusable using VoiceOver.  Below is a very simple code snippet that would create this issue.";

"NESTED_INFORMATION_TEXTVIEW2" = "For developers, grouping information in views allows you to conceptually group areas of functionality, and create sleak, easily scalable applications for multiple view types.  Just remember not to make your container views 'Accessibility Elements' and you're all set.";

//Hints story
"HINT_INFO_TEXTVIEW1" = "Hints identify what an object does.  They provide additional context to users who are not use to using your application.  Hints should start with a capital letter and contain a verb.  Hints should not contain information about the trait, and should avoid duplicating information in the label.  Though, sometimes reiterating the most simple information from the label is helpful.";

"HINT_INFO_TEXTVIEW2" = "Hints provide the information that new users to your application need to help them know what your application does.  Going back to our power users versus new users example, hints help new users.  Ideally as users become accustomed to your application, the information provided in the hint will not be needed.  However, until they've spent enough time using your app, the information contained in the hint is crucial.";

"HINT_EXAMPLE_TEXTVIEW" = "Notice how the visual cues, like the title \"Music Player\" and the style of the \"Play Buttons\" provide context.  Because of these visual cues we already know what these buttons do.";

"HINT_BROKEN_TEXTVIEW" = "Now, without those visual cues, what do these buttons do?  Sure, the accessibility labels of song titles suggest that songs will be played.  But, iOS provides the Hint attribute for us so we can tell users: \"This button plays a song\"";

"HINT_FIXED_TEXTVIEW" = "Now we have added the hint information back onto the buttons.  With these hints, you know that 'Star Spangled Banner' is a song that is going to be played, and not a website that will be visited for further information.";
